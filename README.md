# Todo List

My first React project, a simple todo list application built with React and Vite.

## Features

<ul>
   <li><strong>Add Task:</strong> Add new tasks to the todo list.</li>
   <li><strong>Mark Completed:</strong> Mark tasks as completed.</li>
   <li><strong>Remove Task:</strong> Remove tasks from the list.</li> 
</ul>

## Installation

Make sure you have Node.js and npm installed.

1. Clone the repository:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/luissitoe/todo-list.git
```

2. Navigate to the project directory:

```bash
cd todo-list
```

3. Install dependencies:

```bash
npm install
```

4. Start the development server:

```bash
npm run dev
```

This will open your app in development mode.
